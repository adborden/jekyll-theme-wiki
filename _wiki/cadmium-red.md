Cadmium pigments are a class of pigments that have cadmium as one of the
chemical components. Most of the cadmium produced worldwide has been used in
the production of rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries — themselves being
replaced by other rechargeable nickel-chemistry cell varieties like NiMH
cells[1] — but about half the remaining consumption of cadmium, which is about
2,000 tons annually, is used to produce colored cadmium pigments. The principal
pigments are a family of yellow/orange/red cadmium sulfides and sulfoselenides
as well as compounds with metals other than cadmium.[2]
