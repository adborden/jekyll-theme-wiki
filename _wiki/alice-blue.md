Alice blue is a pale tint of azure that was favored by Alice Roosevelt Longworth, daughter of Theodore Roosevelt, which sparked a fashion sensation in the United States.[citation needed]

The hit song "Alice Blue Gown", inspired by Longworth's signature gown, premiered in Harry Tierney's 1919 Broadway musical Irene. The musical was made into a film in 1940 starring Anna Neagle and Ray Milland.

The color is specified by the United States Navy for use in insignia and trim on U.S. Navy vessels named for Theodore Roosevelt.[citation needed] "AliceBlue" is also one of the original 1987 X11 color names which became the basis for color description in web authoring.
