The color eggshell is meant as a representation of the average color of a chicken egg. Since the color of chicken eggs may vary between pale brown and white, the color is an average between those two, closer to white than pale brown, because more chicken eggs are white.

The source of this color is: ISCC-NBS Dictionary of Color Names (1955)--Color Sample of Eggshell (color sample #92).

In interior design, the color eggshell is commonly used when one desires a pale, warm, neutral, off-white color.
